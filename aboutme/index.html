    <p>Hello Everyone. Let me introduce myself and also get to know my classmates. I'm a Nigerian living in Lagos, Nigeria. I will be 26 years old in few weeks and I'm a single lady. I'm pursuing a degree in professional studies. I've earn my first certificate in Administrative Assistance and I'm currently taking courses for my second certificate in Web And Computer Programming. Although I'm new with this but I found it interesting.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working in a hospitality industry as a Front desk Supervisor. I love to explore and learn new ideas. I enjoy traveling, dancing, listening to music and many other things like helping others and spending time with my family. I and my  family are members of the Church of Jesus christ of Latter-Day Saints. I served in Lagos, Nigeria Mission between 2015-2017. My other 4 sibling did served too. Being members of the Church has been a blessing to my family. I look forward to learning from my instructor and classmates this semester. Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
